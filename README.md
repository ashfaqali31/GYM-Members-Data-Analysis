# GYM-Members-Data-Analysis
Descriptive Statistics and Distribution
•	Age: Calculate the average, median, and distribution of ages to understand the age demographic of gym members.
•	Weight, Height, BMI: Investigate the average weight, height, and BMI of the members. You can also explore any correlations between these variables.
•	Fat Percentage and BMI: See how fat percentage and BMI correlate with each other and whether they provide insights into members’ body composition.

Workout Performance and Trends
•	Max BPM, Avg BPM, Resting BPM:
  o Investigate the relationship between resting heart rate and max heart rate during workouts. Do younger members have a higher max BPM?
  o	You can also see if there's any correlation between workout intensity (based on BPM) and workout type.
•	Calories Burned vs. Session Duration: Plot calories burned against session duration to see if longer sessions lead to more calories burned, and if so, is this linear or not?
•	Workout Type: Analyze the distribution of workout types. You can investigate whether some workout types (like HIIT or Strength) are associated with higher calories burned or better heart rate results.

Member Demographics and Behavior
•	Age vs. Workout Frequency: Does age influence how often people work out? For example, younger people might be more consistent with their workouts than older members.
•	Gender Analysis: Compare workout types, average session duration, and calories burned between male and female members. Are there any noticeable trends or differences?

Experience Level and Fitness Trends
•	Experience Level vs. Session Duration/Workout Type: Compare how beginner, intermediate, and expert members vary in terms of session duration, workout types, and calories burned. Do more experienced members tend to do longer or more intense workouts?
•	Experience Level vs. BMI/Fat Percentage: Are experts more likely to have a lower BMI or fat percentage compared to beginners?

Experience Level and Fitness Trends
•	Experience Level vs. Session Duration/Workout Type: Compare how beginner, intermediate, and expert members vary in terms of session duration, workout types, and calories burned. Do more experienced members tend to do longer or more intense workouts?
•	Experience Level vs. BMI/Fat Percentage: Are experts more likely to have a lower BMI or fat percentage compared to beginners?

Correlation Analysis
•	BMI vs. Fat Percentage: Since both BMI and fat percentage reflect body composition, it's useful to see how strongly these two variables are correlated.
•	Heart Rate vs. Fat Percentage: Check if there's any significant correlation between heart rate metrics (max, average, resting BPM) and body fat percentage. Higher fat percentage might affect heart rate during workouts.

Health Indicators
•	Water Intake vs. Workout Frequency: Investigate whether people who work out more frequently are more likely to have higher water intake.

Gender Analysis
•	Figure out the Workout Frequency of Male and Female Members.
